# Project-Origin

## What Is Project-Origin?

Project-Origin is an OpenSource project to create a **[Federated](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.4503.pdf) Registry**
that handles **Granular Certificates** (GCs). 
The GCs purpose is to prove the origin and potential conversions of energy, thus supporting the green transition and power-to-X (PtX).

## Why Project-Origin?

If one searches for greenwashing, there is no shortages of articles on the internet showing a growing scepticism with [the current system](https://en.energinet.dk/Energy-data/Guarantees-of-origin-el-gas-hydrogen/) for proving the origin of electricity.

Project-Origin was created because there is a need to provide a trustworthy,
**publicly verifiable** way to prove the origin of the electricity one uses on
with a high granularity. 
The project aims to enable extended use of the implementation, to other energy forms than electricity alone. 


## Documentaion
