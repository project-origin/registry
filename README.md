# ProjectOrigin

## What Is ProjectOrigin?

ProjectOrigin is a OpenSource project to create a **Federated Registry**
to handle **Granular Certificates** to prove the origin and conversions
of Energy in the Green transition.

## Why ProjectOrigin?

ProjectOrigin was created because there is a need to provide a
**public verifiable** way to prove the origin of the electricity one uses on
with a high granularity.

If one searches for greenwashing there is no shortages of articles on the
internet showing the growing scepticism with the current system.

## Documentaion

Below is a [system context diagram](https://c4model.com/#SystemContextDiagram) showing what systems the registry integrates with.
