# Pedersen Commitments

> ## tl;dr
> A Pedersen Commitment is a [homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption)
> which enables one to perform calculations on the encrypted data.
>
> The data (`m`) is encrypted using a random value (`r`) which outputs the commitment (`c`).
>
> Commitments enables calculations like `C = C1 * C2` (simplified) where one can verify that
> `C` contains the **sum** of the two messages in `C1` and `C2`.
>
> This enables Project-Origin to prove that the sum of [GC slices](granular-certificates/readme.md?slices)
> are the same as the slice they were created from.

In order to obfuscate sensitive data in the certificates to only be accesible and readable to the owner and verifiable to the reciver of the data (e.g., GSRN numbers, the quantity of energy being transferred, etc.), the data is encrypted using Pedersen commitments. The Pedersen commitment is a commitment scheme that allows the holder of the commitment to commit to a value without revealing the value itself. The commitment can be opened to reveal the value. The holder cannot open it to reveal another value. The commitment scheme is homomorphic in the sense that the product of two commitments will be a commitment to the sum of the two values.

## Pedersen commitments are defined as follows:

$$c=C(m,r)$$

| identifier | property   | usage                                        | accessability |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `c`        | commitment | the commitment itself                        | public        |
| `m`        | message    | the message that is being committed to       | private       |
| `r`        | randomness | the randomness used to commit to the message | private       |

### Additional properties of Pedersen commitments

There are aditional commutation and homomorphism properties that are useful in the Pedersen commitment scheme. These properties are defined as follows:


## What these properties can do in practice for Project-Origin

The Pedersen commitment scheme is used to obfuscate the quantity of energy that is being transferred. The quantity of energy is encrypted using Pedersen commitments. An additional property is that we can add and subtract hidden quantities of energy without revealing the individual quantities to anyone - but you can prove that the result is correct.

### Pedersen commitments are used in the following way to obfuscate the quantity of energy that is being transferred:

We want to show that the sum of the commitments in a certificate (e.g. transactions + remainder) is equal to the committed value in the original production certificate, corresponding to a Commitment to 0 `C_total / ( C_t1 + C_t2 + ... + C_tN + C_remainder ) = C´`. `C´` is the commitment to 0.

$$C´= C_{\text{total}} ~/~ (C_{\text{transactions}} * C_{\text{remainder}})$$

The value in a production certificate may be divided up among several owners (several commitments) and there may be several claims. In this case, we want to show that the product of commitments in the first certificate divided by the product of commitments in the second is a `C´` - commitment to 0 (so the sum of energy quantities is the same in the two certificates).

The possible transactions in the certificate are:
| Type     | description                                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transfer | transfer of ownership of X quantity of units ie. Wh from user A to B        |
| Claim    | claim of ownership of production certificate X to consumption certificate Y |
| Expire   | expiration of remainder of production certificate                           |
| Withdraw | withdrawal of remainder of production certificate                           |

By having unique and random `r` randomness for each transaction, we can prove that the sum of the transactions is equal to the committed value in the original production certificate.

## Group definition:

In order to be able to produce and validate the commitments, we need to define a group. The group is defined as follows:

`G` is a cyclic group of prime order `q` with generator `g`. Let * denote the group operation. We will refter to `*`as multiplication even though in some groups (e.g., elliptic curves) this is often called addition of points on the curve.

### Commitment definition

Given the group G the commitment scheme requires two domain parameters `g`and `h` which are both generators of G. These must be selected independently at random.

A commitment to a message `m`, which is a number between 0 and q-1 is done by selecting `r` at random (also between 0 and q-1) and computing the commitment as `C(m,r) = g^m * h^r`.

A commitment is opened and proven to contain message, `m`, by revealing `r`.

As the commitment is an element of G, two commitments `C1 = C(m1, r1)` and `C2 = C(m2, r2)` can be multiplied in G and the result, `C1 * C2`, will be a commitment to the number `(m1 + m2) modulo q`.


## Future work

Making the Pedersen commitment scheme more efficient by using a more efficient group based on eliptic curve cryptography.
