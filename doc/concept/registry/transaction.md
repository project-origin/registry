A transaction on the ProjectOrigin registry is an operation which applies some change to a transaction-stream.
All transactions are recorded on the specific stream and once recorded, they are immutable.
A transaction-stream always lives on a single registry.
A transaction is always signed using a valid key on the specific stream.
